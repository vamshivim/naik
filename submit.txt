lsof -p [PID] : The tool also lets you display opened files based on process identification (PID) numbers. This can be done by using the -p command line option. 
can be given a pid(we can get pids from ps aux), which will diplay the listof files held by that particular process id.

-->fuser 1.txt (filename): which will give the information about number of users who are accessing given particular file.
--->string -eS 1.dat : which will give information about the printable strings in given file, where e->encoding,s->field seperator(by default it gives a line]
--->ipcs -m: 
ipcs  shows  information  on  the  inter-process communication facilities for which the calling process has read access.  By
       default it shows information about all three resources: shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphore arrays.
ipcs -m: gives info for message segments
ipcs -q:for message queues
ipcs -s:for semphores
ipcs -a:for all the three

--->lsof | head -1: which will header names of lsof output
--->lsof | grep #number: which will give the particular files holded by that particular processid(pid given)
--->lsof /users/mtech/18mcmb07/Desktop/jos/: which gives information about the files which are holded by given directory.
